										<p><strong>Planning your off road activity</strong></p>
										<p>The first thing that comes in mind when in Bullhead City, AZ or Laughlin, NV is to look for a day rental for a boat or a jet ski on the Colorado River.</p>

											<p><strong>What about a guided UTV rental or experience?</strong></p>
											<h2> Unforgettable Memories in the Arizona Desert</h2>
											<p>When my husband and I used to go on vacation, we would always go off-roading because we are both passionate about it. We are so passionate that we decided to open our own business, OUI Experience, that offers off-roading tours. Instead of offering rentals we decided to offer guided adventures to help everyone create memories that they will treasure forever.</p>

												<h2> What is an ATV</h2>
												<div style="text-align: center;">
													<img src="images/ATV in Desert.png" alt="utv in desert" height = "500px" />
													</div>
													<p>What kind of vehicle do you want to drive and what is your budget for the rental?
														<br>The ATVs are the cheapest.</p>
												<h2> What is a UTV?</h2>
												<div style="text-align: center;">
													<img src="images/Can am Maverick with OUI Experience.jpg" alt="can am maverick with oui experience" height = "500px" />
													</div>
													
														<br><p>UTV rentals are most expensive but also the most comfortable and the easiest to ride of all the off road vehicles.</p>
												<br>
														<h2>Renting an ATV/UTV vs Guided Tours: Which is Right for You?</h2>
													<br>
													<p>A guided tour means that an experienced guide is driving a vehicle in front of you and you follow him.</p>
													<p>A full day rental means you explore the desert trail on your own.</p>
													<br>
													<div style="text-align: center;">

														</div>
														<br>
													<h2> Private Guided Tour</h2>	
													<p>We decided to do private guided experiences because we want to show you the most breathtaking views. That's why a guided tour is a life changing experience. It gives you a break from having to decide everything and gives you a chance to live life. Jake does a fantastic job helping everyone have the time of their lives. Look at any review that we have if you are not convinced yet.</p>

														<br>
														<p>Our most popular experience is the Full House Experience, you drive for 4 hours we go 4500 feet up a mountain, down to the waterfront through canyons, to an old abandoned mine through 8 different desert terrains.</p>
														<p>In our one hour experience, you drive for 1 hour across the Black Mountain range.</p>
														<br>
														<h2>Benefits of Choosing a Family-Owned Off-Road Adventure.</h2>
														<br>
														<p>We are a small family-owned business (My husband Jake and I) and we want you to have the most amazing time of your life in the Mojave Desert!</p>
														<div style="text-align: center;">

															<p>We are about 60 minutes from Bullhead City and Laughlin, and we do not provide transportation, but we will make sure that your trip is worth it. Most of the people that came to our great experience rented a car.</p>
